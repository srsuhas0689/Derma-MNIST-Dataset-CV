# Derma-MNIST-Dataset-CV

Derma MNIST is a dataset used in the field of computer vision and machine learning. It consists of images of skin lesions categorized into different classes. The dataset is designed as a benchmark for developing and evaluating machine learning algorithms for skin disease classification.

The Derma MNIST dataset is derived from the HAM10000 (Human Against Machine with 10000 training images) dataset, which contains a collection of 10,015 dermatoscopic images of skin lesions. The HAM10000 dataset was created by the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) and represents a diverse range of common skin lesions, including melanoma, nevi (moles), and various types of benign and malignant skin tumors.

To create the Derma MNIST dataset, the original images from HAM10000 were resized to 28x28 pixels and grayscale converted. Each image was assigned a corresponding class label, representing one of the different skin lesion types. The dataset aims to replicate the format of the popular MNIST dataset, which is commonly used for handwritten digit classification tasks.

Derma MNIST serves as a more challenging version of the MNIST dataset, providing a real-world application scenario for machine learning models to classify skin lesions accurately. It enables researchers and developers to explore and develop algorithms for automatic skin disease diagnosis, which can have significant implications for early detection and treatment of skin cancer and other dermatological conditions.

It's important to note that while Derma MNIST can be used as a starting point for skin disease classification tasks, real-world clinical diagnosis requires more extensive datasets, additional patient information, and often the expertise of dermatologists.
